/*
GoCipher en- and decrypts messages using simple, common ciphers over the command line.
It is meant for personal and for-fun use only.
Usage:

	goCipher [subcommand] [arguments]

Subcommands are:

	ceasar
		The famous ceasar cipher, a simple alphabetic shift cipher.
	vigenere
		The classic Vigen√®re cipher, a polyalphabetic cipher that used a key and a tabula recta.
	playfair
		A polygraphic substitution cipher, which encrypts digraphs instead of single letters.

If you choose to run the subcommand without its optional arguments, the default values will be taken.
